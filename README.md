🏠 Housing Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive housing dataset that includes key attributes of residential properties—such as price, location, size, and condition. The main objective is to extract meaningful insights that can help stakeholders in the real estate industry make data-driven decisions.

📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains detailed information on residential properties, including:

Date: Record date of property information
Price: Sale price of the property
Bedrooms / Bathrooms: Number of rooms in the property
Sqft_living / Sqft_lot: Square footage of living area and land
Floors: Number of floors
Waterfront: Binary indicator of waterfront view
View: Quality rating of the property's view (0–4)
Condition: Overall condition (1–5)
Sqft_above / Sqft_basement: Above-ground and basement area
Yr_built / Yr_renovated: Construction and renovation years
Street / City / Statezip / Country: Location details
✅ Project Tasks
1. 🔧 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handle missing values using imputation or removal
Fix inconsistent or erroneous data entries
Encode categorical variables for analysis
2. 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate: Distribution and stats for variables like price, bedrooms, bathrooms
Bivariate: Relationship analysis (e.g., price vs. sqft_living)
Multivariate: Correlation and pattern analysis across multiple variables
3. 📊 Visualization
Use histograms, box plots, scatter plots, etc.
Visualize trends, outliers, and geographical price patterns
4. 🏗 Feature Engineering
Create new features like property age, price per sqft
Derive additional attributes that support deeper analysis
5. 📌 Insights & Interpretation
Identify key price drivers: location, size, condition, etc.
Provide actionable recommendations for real estate stakeholders
